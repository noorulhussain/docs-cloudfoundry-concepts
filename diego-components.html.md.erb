##<a id='core'></a>Diego Core Components##

Components in the Diego core run and monitor Tasks and Long Running Processes (LRPs). The core consists of three major areas: the [Brain](#brain-components), the [Bulletin Board System](#bbs) (BBS), and the [Cells](#cell-components).

###<a id='brain-components'></a>Diego Brain ###

Diego Brain components distribute Tasks and LRPs to Diego [Cells](#cell-components), and correct discrepancies between `ActualLRP` and `DesiredLRP` counts to ensure fault-tolerance and long-term consistency. The Diego Brain consists of the [Auctioneer](#auctioneer) and the [Converger](#converger).

<a id='auctioneer'></a>
#### Auctioneer ####

- Uses the [auction](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/auction) package
to run [Diego auctions](./diego-auction.html) for Tasks and `ActualLRP` instances

- Communicates with Cell [Reps](#rep) over HTTP

- Maintains a lock in the [BBS](#bbs) that restricts auctions to one Auctioneer at a time

Refer to the [Auctioneer repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/auctioneer) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='converger'></a>
#### Converger ####

- Uses converge methods from the Runtime-Schema to analyze snapshots of the [BBS](#bbs) to ensure consistency and fault tolerance for Tasks and LRPs

- Acts to keep `DesiredLRP` count and `ActualLRP` count synchronized in the following ways:
    - If the `DesiredLRP` count exceeds the `ActualLRP` count, the Converger requests a start auction from the [Auctioneer](#auctioneer)
    - If the `ActualLRP` count exceeds the `DesiredLRP` count, the Converger sends a stop message to the [Rep](#rep) on the [Cell](#cell-components) hosting an instance

- Monitors for potentially missed messages, resending them if necessary

- Maintains a lock in the [BBS](#bbs) that limits converger performance to one Converger at a time

Refer to the [Converger repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/converger) on GitHub for more information.

###<a id='bbs'></a>Diego Bulletin Board System ###

The Bulletin Board System (BBS) maintains a real-time representation of the state of the Diego cluster, including all desired LRPs, running LRP instances, and in-flight Tasks. The BBS accepts submissions, updates, and requests for Tasks and LRPs from clients through an RPC-style API over HTTP.

Refer to the [Bulletin Board System repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bbs) on GitHub for more information.

---

###<a id='cell-components'></a>Diego Cell Components ###

Diego Cell components manage and maintain Tasks and LRPs.

<a id='receptor'></a>

	- New Tasks
	- Changes to `DesiredLRPs`
	- Information about running Tasks and LRP instances

Refer to the [Receptor repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/receptor) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='rep'></a>
#### Rep ####

- Represents a Cell in [Diego auctions](./diego-auction.html) for Tasks and LRPs

- Mediates all communication between the Cell and the [Bulletin Board System](#bbs) (BBS)

- Ensures synchronization between the set of Tasks and `ActualLRPs` in the [BBS](#bbs) with the containers present on the Cell

- Maintains the presence of the Cell in the [BBS](#bbs)

- Runs Tasks and LRPs by asking the in-process [Executor](#executor) to create a container and `RunAction` recipes

Refer to the [Rep repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/rep) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='executor'></a>
#### Executor ####

- Implements the generic Executor actions detailed in the [API documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/receptor/blob/master/doc/actions.md)

- Streams `STDOUT` and `STDERR` to the [Metron agent](#metron-agent) running on the Cell

Refer to the [Executor repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/executor) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='garden'></a>
#### Garden ####

- Provides a platform-independent server and clients to manage Garden containers

- Defines the [garden-linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux) interface for container implementation

Refer to the [Garden repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='metron-agent'></a>
#### Metron Agent ####

Forwards application logs, errors, and application and Diego metrics to the [Loggregator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator) Doppler component 

Refer to the [Metron repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/tree/develop/src/metron) on GitHub for more information.

##<a id='bridge-components'></a>CC-Bridge Components ##

CC-Bridge components translate app-specific requests from the Cloud Controller to the [Receptor](#receptor), the RESTful API for Diego. These components include the following:

<a id='stager'></a>
### Stager ###

- Translates staging requests from the Cloud Controller into generic Tasks for the [Receptor](#receptor)

- Sends a response to the Cloud Controller when a Task completes

Refer to the [Stager repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stager) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='nsync'></a>
### Nsync ###

- Consumes app requests to update the `DesiredLRPs` count and submits it to the [Receptor](#receptor)

- Periodically polls Cloud Controller for each app to ensure Diego has current desired state 

Refer to the [Nsync repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/nsync) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='tps'></a>
### TPS ###

The TPS provides the Cloud Controller with information about currently running LRPs to respond to `cf apps` and `cf app APP_NAME` requests

Refer to the [TPS repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/tps) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='cc-uploader'></a>
### CC-Uploader ###

- Mediates uploads from the [Executor](#executor) to the Cloud Controller  

- Translates simple HTTP POST requests from the [Executor](#executor) into complex multipart-form uploads for the Cloud Controller

Refer to the [CC-Uploader repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cc-uploader) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='file-server'></a>
### File Server ###

- Serves static assets used by various Diego components

Refer to the [File Server repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/file-server) on GitHub for more information.

##<a id='platform-specific'></a>Platform-specific Components ##

<a id='backends'></a>
### Garden Backends ###

Garden contains a set of interfaces that each platform-specific backend must implement. These interfaces contain methods to perform the following actions:

- Create and delete containers
- Apply resource limits to containers
- Open and attach network ports to containers
- Copy files into and out of containers
- Run processes within containers
- Stream `STDOUT` and `STDERR` data out of containers
- Annotate containers with arbitrary metadata
- Snapshot containers for redeploys without downtime

Refer to the [Garden repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden) on GitHub for more information.

<a id='backend-implementations'></a>
#### Current Implementations ####

- [Garden-Linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux) provides a Linux-specific implementation of a Garden interface.

<a id='app-lifecycles'></a>
### App Lifecycles ###

App Lifecycles implement deployment strategies. Each App Lifecycle contains the following three binaries:

- The **Builder**, which stages a CF application. The [CC-Bridge](#bridge-components) runs the Builder as a Task on every staging request. The Builder performs static analysis on the application code and does any necessary pre-processing before the application is first run.

- The **Launcher**, which runs a CF application. The [CC-Bridge](#bridge-components) sets the Launcher as the Action on the `DesiredLRP` for the application. The Launcher executes the start command with the correct system context, including working directory and environment variables.

- The **Healthcheck**, which performs a status check on running CF application from inside the container. The [CC-Bridge](#bridge-components) sets the Healthcheck as the Monitor action on the `DesiredLRP` for the application. 

<a id='lifecycle-implementations'></a>
#### Current Implementations ####

- [Buildpack App Lifecycle](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-app-lifecycle) implements the Cloud Foundry buildpack-based deployment strategy.

- [Docker App Lifecycle](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/docker-app-lifecycle) implements a Docker deployment strategy.
